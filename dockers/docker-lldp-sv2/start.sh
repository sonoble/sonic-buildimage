# Current lldpd version has a bug.
# When lldpd starts it is in the pause state by default
# But then it execute 'lldpcli resume' to configure and unpause itself.
# When lldpd execute lldpcli, it doesn't check the return code
# Sometimes lldpcli returns failure, but lldpd doesn't catch it
# and keeps working paused and unconfigured
#
# The fix below addresses the issue.
#

# wait until lldpd started
until [[ -e /var/run/lldpd.socket ]];

    sleep 1;
done

# Manually try to resume lldpd, until it's successful
